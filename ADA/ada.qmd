# About the ADA project

---

The Analytical Data Access (ADA) service has been created to support analysts, engineers and policy team members.

It brings together:
*	a searchable data catalogue - the Data Discovery Platform (DDP)
*	a workbench of tools for analysing data - including Databricks
*	a form for requesting access to data
*	a support section - with walkthrough instructions
*	a collection of data reports and dashboards
*	a news and updates area.

As long as you're connected to the network - it's available to anyone who works for the Department of Education.
