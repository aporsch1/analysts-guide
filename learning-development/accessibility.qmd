<p class="text-muted">Some quick links and tips for increasing awareness of accessibility in digital content</p>

## Accessibility in DfE

Everyone has a part to play in ensuring that the content and digital services the DfE provides to its customers and colleagues are accessible. Everyone should have an understanding of their responsibilities to comply with the [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made) and the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). Moreover, everyone should also understand the important and critical difference this makes to the everyday lives of millions of people.

DfE have our own [Digital Accessibility Hub](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00043) filled with helpful information on making the digital world more accessible.

There are also the [DfE design manual](https://design.education.gov.uk), which has been created by the digital teams at DfE and includes [DfE's digital accessibility guidance](https://design.education.gov.uk/accessibility).


If you want to estimate or try to appreciate just how many people might have specific needs, there is the [How many people? tool](https://design.education.gov.uk/tools/how-many-users), simply enter how many people your audience is, and it will give you best estimates of how many people might have a disability, impairment or other characteristics which might affect how they use your service.

## Free tools for reviewing web pages

- [axe DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?pli=1), free Google Chrome extension and paid versions, we recommend this (and Government Digital Service tend to recommend too)

- [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview), built into Google Chrome browser, and will catch some basic accessibility things amongst other web related issues

'Bookmarklets' are bookmarks that instead of saving a URL to a page, save a piece of Javascript code that executes on the page you are looking at. There's some nice [accessibility focused bookmarklets](https://design.education.gov.uk/accessibility/assurance) that highlight specific types of mark up such as headers and lists so you can easily check if it matches what you'd expect while on any webpage. Very nifty and low effort too!

## Making spreadsheets accessible

When creating an accessible spreadsheet, it’s important to consider the needs of all users, including those with disabilities. To support analysts in making spreadsheets more accessible, here are five simple yet effective strategies:

 a. Consult the Spreadsheet Accessibility Guidance

Before diving into the spreadsheet creation process, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the official [spreadsheet accessibility](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/) guidance available on the Analysis Function Guidance Hub. This resource offers comprehensive insights into best practices for ensuring that your spreadsheets are accessible to all users.

### Accessibility and consequences

Public sector spreadsheets must meet the AA level of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, as required by law under The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018. This guidance distinguishes between mandatory actions needed to comply with legal accessibility standards and best practices that enhance usability. Non-compliance can lead to legal complaints, making it crucial for content creators to understand and mitigate these risks.

In addition to accessibility, the guidance also addresses usability and machine readability. While these areas often overlap with accessibility, there are instances where they may conflict. Depending on user needs, it might be necessary to produce separate versions of a spreadsheet—one for human use and another optimized for machine readability—to ensure both accessibility and functionality are maintained.

 b. Automate Accessibility During the Coding Process

Automation is a powerful way to ensure that accessibility is consistently applied throughout the spreadsheet creation process, especially when working with large datasets or producing numerous spreadsheets. By integrating accessibility into the coding process, you can streamline your workflow and reduce the chances of missing critical accessibility features.

Here’s how you can automate accessibility using specific tools in Python and R:

1. For Python Users – gptables Package:

- Overview: The ``gptables`` package is designed to help Python users create accessible tables within spreadsheets. This package automates the formatting of tables to meet accessibility standards, ensuring that key elements such as table headers, data descriptions, and structures are correctly implemented.
- Benefits: By using ``gptables``, you can automatically generate tables that are readable by screen readers, properly formatted for navigation, and compliant with accessibility regulations. This reduces the manual effort required to adjust table formats and enhances consistency across multiple spreadsheets.

2. For R Users – ``a11ytables`` Package:

- Overview: The ``a11ytables`` package in R serves a similar purpose by helping users create accessible tables within their spreadsheets. The package includes functions that facilitate the creation of tables with correct headers, descriptive text, and appropriate structures, making them accessible to all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.
- Benefits: Using ``a11ytables`` ensures that your spreadsheets are automatically optimized for accessibility, minimizing the need for manual intervention. It’s particularly useful when producing multiple tables, as it maintains consistent formatting and accessibility standards throughout your documents.

Why Automate?

- Consistency: Automation helps maintain a consistent approach to accessibility across all spreadsheets, reducing the likelihood of human error.
- Efficiency: Automating the process saves time, especially when dealing with large datasets or generating numerous tables.
- Compliance: These tools help ensure that your spreadsheets meet legal accessibility requirements without extensive manual adjustments, reducing the risk of non-compliance.

By incorporating tools like ``gptables`` or ``a11ytables`` into your coding workflow, you can enhance the accessibility of your spreadsheets with minimal extra effort, making your data more inclusive and easier to use for everyone.

## Assistive technology

No automated tools fully cover accessibility, manual testing is always required, so if you want to do manual testing have a look at testing out the assistive software commonly used by users yourself.

Magnifiers / advanced zoom:

- Windows Magnifier, comes as standard with Windows ([guidance for how to turn on Magnifier](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198#:~:text=To%20quickly%20turn%20on%20Magnifier,turn%20on%20the%20Magnifier%20switch.))

Cognitive load:

- While there isn't commonly used specific assistive technology for aiding users in reducing cognitive load, you can take many steps to reduce the cognitive load for users on your service, making it simpler to use for all. Have a read of [Cognitive Load as a Guide: 12 Spectrums to Improve Your Data Visualisations](https://nightingaledvs.com/cognitive-load-as-a-guide-12-spectrums-to-improve-your-data-visualizations/) as a starting point if you want to learn more.

Along with devices and the software mentioned above, the [experience lab in the Sheffield DfE office](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00043/SitePages/Experience-Lab.aspx) also has a range of other equipment available, including access to a set of vision emulating glasses that you can wear to emulate different visual impairments.
